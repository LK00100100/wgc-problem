A classic conundrum.

You have a wolf, a goat, one big cabbage, and a boat. You are trying to get to the other side of the river with everything.
However, there is a problem. You cannot leave certain elements alone unless the man is there. If you leave things alone without the man, they will eat each other.
- The wolf will eat the goat.
- The goat will eat the cabbage.

Along with yourself, you can cross the river with the boat and one other thing.
